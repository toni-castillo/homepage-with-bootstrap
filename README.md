# ðŸ“° Homepage of a lifestyle magazine with Bootstrap

Responsive homepage of a fictitious lifestyle magazine created with **HTML, CSS and, mainly, Bootstrap** as practice exercise for the Bootstrap and Sass module of the Codehouse Academy bootcamp.

The teacher provided two screenshots, one of how the web looks on desktop and the other on mobile as you can see, with the objective of reproducing it using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
